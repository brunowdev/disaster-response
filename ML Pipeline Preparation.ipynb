The severe drought parching east Africa has left 10 million facing hunger and the scope of one of the world's worst unfolding humanitarian disasters conjured up memories of Ethiopia's devastating 1984 famine. Seismologists agree that Padang will face more earthquakes in future, and warn that a much larger quake with far greater destructive force is inevitable in the region. The flash floods that followed torrential monsoonal rains in north-west Pakistan between 28 and 30 July have caused great loss of life and wide-spread damage to infrastructure, livestock and property in more than 100 villages. Lesotho and Swaziland would also experience scattered rains, he noted. But while floodwaters have subsided in some areas, there has been fresh flooding in the north of the state and more heavy rainfall forecast elsewhere. Approximately 1.9 million people have been affected in the past week by heavy torrential monsoon rains which flooded 195 blocks in 14 districts of the State of West Bengal. Separately, the West Java administration has said it plans to once more dredge the Citarum river to reduce the mass of sedimentation that contributes to the area's annual floods. With the help of the American Red Cross, Mr. Fernando and his family are using a compost bin to help remove from the streets household garbage that blocks drains and causes flooding. Continuing, he said the United Nations and its partners were also pursuing ways to promote water harvesting and implement modernized irrigation facilities so communities in the region were not totally dependent on rainwater to keep crops alive during dry spells. It may be mentioned here that long range forecasts of the Indian southwest monsoon rainfall are generated by many other national and global centres which employ different prediction techniques. The availability of feed from grain and crop residues has also fallen sharply due to the drop in agricultural production, especially in rainfed areas. Last year, hundreds of people died in several avalanches following record snowfalls. The northern and eastern parts of the country received less rain in the past northeastern monsoon and expect inter monsoonal showers these days. The initial assessments indicated that nearly 15,000 people had been affected - already double the estimates made on Tuesday - with over 8,000 left without shelter and two people dead. The southern African nation of Mozambique has once again been inundated by flood waters and hurricane force winds. Furthermore, the most recent cyclone to hit the country, tropical storm Manou, killed more than 70 people in May, severed roads and bridges and caused extensive damage to agricultural land. A blanket of acrid smog covered the sweltering capital itself, worsening the woes of Muscovites gasping in Russia's hottest weather since record-keeping began around 1880. Where localised flooding has forced the evacuation of whole communities, the authorities have moved residents to safer areas. This rapid-response shipment includes critically needed supplies to care for the thousands injured in Saturday's disaster: first-aid supplies, materials for making casts to set broken arms and legs, walkers, canes, crutches, warm weather clothing for hospital patients and hygiene kits. Further bad weather is predicted, with the government issuing a cyclone warning for Karachi and other coastal communities in the coming days. Two people were killed when a tree uprooted by the wind fell on them at a village in Chandpur district 170 km (106 miles) southeast of the capital Dhaka on Sunday. 4-7 February: Torrential rain coupled with seasonal rainfall leads to some of the worst flooding in Mozambique in more than half a century. The pledges made, in order of magnitude in terms of per annum commitments, included the following:. The cyclone and subsequent flooding in Baluchistan have killed 25 people, while 12 people were killed on Thursday in a separate deluge in the northwest of the country. More funds are needed to provide medicines, food and shelter. In the wake of the system temperatures are forecast to fall far below zero, with accompanying wind chill factor. By Himadri Ahsan, IFRC The monsoon depression over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh coast intensified into a cyclonic storm named 'Komen' on Wednesday, 29 July, threatening to cause further downpours in regions that are already affected by the recent flash floods and deadly landslides. Freaky winter storms have plagued southern China since mid-January, leading to widespread traffic jams, structural collapse, blackouts and crop loss in 21 provincial-level regions. Skin diseases due to poor hygiene or biting insects are widespread and reported to be a major problem in Dadu district. Roiling floods triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rain have scoured Pakistan's Indus river basin, killing more than 1,600 people, forcing 2 million from their homes and disrupting the lives of about 14 million people, or 8 percent of the population. JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia's neighbors on Friday sent in firefighters to train Indonesian crews battling bushfires on Sumatra island as the haze-making blazes spread. It was the second severe hail storm to hit the province this month. The lack of sanitation - particularly latrines - poses a more serious as residents of all three camps have no choice but to defecate in bushland or on the beach. Today the children of Qungkunchack village are taking classes in the open air in near zero degree temperatures. The Meteorological Department has forecast rainfall would decrease from Thursday to Saturday, but return in the North and Northeast on Sunday and Monday. Tens of thousands were killed when the world's strongest earthquake in 40 years unleashed flash floods and giant waves on South and Southeast Asia. To keep their herd alive, she corralled the animals into tight pens while her husband Batdorj trudged into the darkness and blowing snow to look for strays. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. While on the visit of the village after the storm, the Prime Minister Edward Lowasa called on the people to build stronger structures for safer housing of their families and plant more trees that would act as wind breakers during stormy weather. A State of Emergency was declared today (21 August) by the authorities in Hunan Province while the water level of Dongting Lake, the second largest fresh water lake in China, continues to rise (Dongting Lake acts as a giant overflow for the flood prone Yangtze River). The agency said the intermittent downpours of the last several days would be followed by heavy rains and perhaps even tornadoes. National experts in infrastructure damage assessment (six weeks). Luoyang city experienced six days of continuous heavy rain, with the average daily rainfall reaching 100 millimeters (four inches), the report said. The KRCS has been distributing mosquito nets in a bid to prevent malaria epidemics. Having its origin in the Chitral Gol National Park, the stream was seen carrying with it a large number of deodar logs. In addition, it is extremely prone to natural disasters; such as floods, drought, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, snowfall, typhoons and cyclones which have important social and economic consequences. BEIJING, Aug 5, 2006 (AFP) - Typhoon Prapiroon killed at least 31 people and left 14 others missing after crashing ashore in southern China, state media reported Saturday, announcing the latest casualty figures. Reports indicate at least 40 people were killed and more than 180 others injured following the earthquake that struck south-east Iran deep beneath the surface with tremors felt across Pakistan, India and the Gulf States. To date, authorities have listed 190 Fukushima workers as victims of radiation sickness, the most acute form of radiation exposure that results in damage to multiple organ systems, skin burns, and usually a slow deterioration and death. MADRID, March 18 (Reuters) - International humanitarian groups are finding pockets of suffering in northern Japan, but say most victims of the earthquake, tsunami, and snow blizzards are keeping warm and getting food, water and medical attention. Papua New Guinea is on the Pacific volcanic belt known as the ''Ring of Fire,'' and has more than a dozen active volcanoes. KYANGIN  -  Due to the rising tides of Ayeyawady River from erosion, 13 families from four villages in Yelekyun village in Kyangin Township were evacuated to safer locations on 3 September. MUMBAI, July 5, 2006 (AFP) - Large tracts of India's western financial hub of Mumbai were under water Wednesday as the weather bureau warned further heavy rains were on the way and the death toll from the monsoon deluge rose to nine. The disaster has been compounded by a severe winter storm. TOKYO, Dec 28, 2004 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Japan Tuesday sent a Maritime Self- Defense Force convoy, including a helicopter, to waters off Thailand to help search for missing people following Sunday's earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in the Southeast and South Asian region. Only spotty light rain is expected during the period. Half of Bibi's tent floor was soaked in rain water, making the plunging temperatures nearly unbearable at night, she said. Recent snow flurries and fog have prevented the planned airdrops from taking place as frequently as had been hoped, and the increasingly muddy roads make truck convoys hazardous at times. On 17 August, approximately 25 veterinarians, sponsored by FAO, arrived in Badakhshan to commence the summer vaccination campaign. In Indonesia, CWS has focused on four main activities: emergency distribution of food and non-food items for over 12,000 internally displaced people in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar; a mobile clinic medical team and a psychosocial mental health team serving displaced people; and water supply and sanitation in Meulaboh. The national seismological network said the quake jolted the juncture between Sichuan's Suining City and Tongnan County of Chongqing Municipality at 5:36 a.m. Weather officials said islands in the Bay of Bengal were gripped by high tides caused by monsoon clouds, and warned all fishing boats to return to their bases. They failed to evacuate after the second powerful quake struck and got trapped in the hotel rubble, said the staffer, who gave his name as Harun.\",\n",

A protocol for drug disposal has been developed and is now awaiting approval by local health authorities. Mercy Corps is working to turn around this situation for villagers like Haji Mohammad Alem, who dream of sustainable farms and economic independence. To maintain the region's precious biodiversity, the PIF Leaders remain strongly committed to strengthening conservation management efforts in the Pacific islands region, in line with the Pacific Islands Action Strategy for Nature Conservation which emphasizes the importance of local conservation to community and in collaboration with relevant technical organizations. The pollutants that entered the river started to move downstream in a plume of contaminated water that is now estimated to be about 110 km long. BEIJING (July 6) XINHUA - China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress (NPC), today examined last year's use of disaster relief funds and equipment. There are also a total of 186 flooded houses and 3,464 roofless houses. Three months after the tsunamis struck southern Tamil Nadu state where Nagapattinam is situated, tens of thousands of survivors, mostly fishermen, are still living in temporary shelters made of asbestos sheeting and tin roofs. The protesters burnt tyres and overturned garbage cans in the streets, blocking traffic for a part of the morning. As of the end of January, four ablution blocks, each consisting of four latrines, four bathing stations and four adjoining septic tanks, are now completed and functioning to serve the residents of the Olora settlement. Since then, ADRA has also rehabilitated a hospital and trialed a project that will use biogas plants to produce a year-round energy supply. The homeless and streetchildren were prioritised. In Somaliland, clearing of the pipeline route for the Erigavo water project and construction of the Boon water supply has started. In addition to targeting farmers and livestock producers, the program is expected to directly benefit agricultural researchers, extension agents, seed producers and farm input suppliers. With the upcoming winter all children, especially those living in tents in the relief camps, where conditions are difficult, crowded and draughty, are at high risk of contracting respiratory infection. Despite the interim measures adopted by the Delhi High Court on 7 January 2010 requesting the immediate restoration of the homeless shelter and the protection of the displaced families, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has not yet assisted them. Polio staff at country level spend, on average, 50% of their time working on broader public health efforts, over and beyond polio eradication.

Thailand: The Bureau of Epidemiology is investigating dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Phuket following increased case reports. BALOCHISTAN, Pakistan, 23 July, 2007 - When Cyclone Yemyin tore into Northern Balochistan one month ago, it took only a short period of time before the village of Kuch Valari was completely submerged under raging torrents of muddy waters. Thailand: The Bureau of Epidemiology is investigating dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Phuket following increased case reports. Setting up the working groups is expected to be a drawn out affair and will not be helped by the complicated and contentious nature of some of the topics to be covered - legal and constitutional reforms, the bias of both state institutions and the media towards the ruling party - and the limited technical capacity of RENAMO to participate in them. The initial interventions - which many agencies engaged in on a larger scale than previously - were \\'cash for work\\', where beneficiaries were paid for basic work which varied from desalinating farm land and clearing rubble to rebuilding houses and burying bodies. Ground water and river water -- the main drinking water sources in the camps -- have also been contaminated by sewage and silt washed into rivers has clogged up water filtration systems. The storm has been fearsome but there is light in the darkness: thanks to the concerted action of government, the media, charities and the local people, countless human lives have been saved from the wrath of this cyclone. Many receive cooked meals from TRO and several receive food from public donations which is then cooked at the camp. Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including special economic assistance: special economic assistance to individual countries or regions. The surprising development is being engineered by a Somali-American technocrat intent on ending his native country\\'s reputation as a failed state. The ShelterBox Response Team (SRT) on the ground in Nigeria has been working with Rotary in the flood stricken country, whilst awaiting the arrival of the first consignment of boxes. WHO is also ensuring access to essential health care to all those affected by the tragedy and helping to coordinate medical supplies to ensure that supply chains are working and that medicines are reaching where they are needed. These activities have involved the formation of farmers groups interested in collectively irrigating their lands, the provision of small, hand and engine driven pumps on credit to farmers and the training of the same farmers in maintenance of these pumps. Sudan believed in legal pluralism, and warned against attempts to impose a single legal culture reflecting one civilian that controlled others through imperialism and the imposition of force. The rains, which broke 30 year records in Mombassa, caused floods, landslides, washed away bridges and houses, damaged roads and disrupted water supplies. Risk of outbreaks is particularly acute in Ampara and Kalmunai, due to inadequate sanitation facilities (1,000 people reportedly have access to just three latrines). As a result of these inter-related causes, a number of vital social service provision sectors are unable to cope.

At least 3,500 dead after 6.3-magnitude quake strikes Java's central region. The powerful cyclone smashed into the low-lying Irrawaddy delta, unleashing a storm surge as high as 12 feet, according to Reuters. On the night of 15 to 16 July, a hail storm with strong winds in Labé, middle Guinea, damaged homes and affected 869 households, and destroyed 322 hectares of crops, according to UN and government humanitarian officials just back from an evaluation of the area. Ministry officials said they had been trying to deploy health workers to badly affected areas using two military helicopters, but the aircraft were only of limited use due to the continuing appalling weather conditions, a spokesman said. SHANGHAI, June 15, 2009 (AFP) - At least 14 people were killed and more than 180 others were injured in a severe hail storm that destroyed thousands of homes across eastern China's Anhui province, authorities said Monday. By August 29, kharif crops were sown in 966.25 lakh hectares. Floods triggered by monsoon rains are affecting some 5.4 million people and displaced 1.8 million, according to the agency. SATKORLAK PB East Nusa Tenggara reported that flash floods occurred in Reok Sub-district and landslides hit seven sub-districts, namely Cibal, Wae Ri'I, Lamba Leda, Poco Ranaka, Ruteng, Langke Rembong, and Kota Komba. But the roads that remain along the coast are now in deeper water, the mud remains, the potential for disease increases, and the cold dampness causes people on the margins to be even more vulnerable. A massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale shook Nepal on late Saturday killing and injuring many people. To meet these needs, NRC organised two trainings for 78 male and female primary school teachers in Bajaur and Mohmand Agencies with the objective to enhance the capacity in current teaching-learning approaches, including lesson planning, class room management, dropout prevention, community mobilization and child psychology. In neighbouring Algeria to the east, a massive quake struck the densely populated coastal region with its epicentre near the capital Algiers in May 2003, killing more than 2,300 people and injuring about 10,000. To date, total private contributions from the U.S. to earthquake relief and reconstruction are estimated at $130 million. In the middle and southern part of Zhejiang province, due to the continuous rainfall, the water levels in Qiantang river, Ou river and Feiyun river exceeded the warning line as well as the danger line. (A true drought is usually the result of more than two successive rain failures.). The process of payment of compensation to the affectees has been expedited in order to enable affectees to start construction of their houses in wake of severe cold weather in the Area. The past week brought slight relief in many areas of northern and southern Somalia, with 7-day total rainfall accumulations exceeding 10mm in some locations. BEIJING, Aug 16 (AFP) - Some 200 people are dead or missing following three days of flash flooding that hit central China's Hunan province, officials said Monday. Governments, civil society and humanitarian agencies needed to prepare strategies to cope with the impact of, among others, an increased number of hydro-meteorological disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones floods and mudslides. These children lived in areas where the quake damaged or destroyed at least 60% of structures.

Workers are also preparing to purchase large quantities of tin in order to repair some of the hundreds of homes damaged by the storms. Women are able to come to the riverbed, scoop into the sand, and find water rather than walking for hours in search of the life sustaining resource. In the Labutta Township, ADRA is partnering with various donors including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department for International Development (DFID) of the British Government to increase access to clean water among vulnerable cyclone-affected people by cleaning the local water reservoirs or \\'ponds,\\' and providing water purification units, jerry cans, household kits, shelter materials, tool kits, and other goods prior to the end of the rainy season. Local public health authorities are instructed to educate people on how to prevent the diseases while residents living in inundated areas are warned not to defecate and throw rubbish into the water to prevent risks of waterborne diseases. Community radios are broadcasting health and hygiene messages and mobile media units are conducting social mobilisation and outreach activities in resettlement centres. Together with the ASG, the Federation\\'s head of delegation will monitor the ongoing operation on a daily basis and actively seek to achieve optimum co-operation and co-ordination with authorities and all involved.

The disaster occurred when 2 wagons loaded with dynamite caught in overhead cables causing a massive explosion. AmeriCares is providing 3.1 million water purifying sachets to be distributed through training programs to replenish water stocks for three camp-based water and sanitation programs in Kenya and for communities suffering famine in southern Ethiopia. Following requests from two districts in Assam and West Bengal, UNICEF has already committed US$ 90,000 for flood relief as part of accelerated programming. The helicopter rescues, saving people from rooftops and treetops, whisking others from small muddy islands.. Under these circumstances, helicopter pilots had to make tough decisions, and often those decisions were to rescue the very young and very old as a priority. Residual mental disease that one would see in any population has not been attended to for years in Afghanistan as it was mired in conflict, deepening poverty and enveloped by intolerance. 170,000 good quality plastic sheets were needed urgently to cover tents and 200,000 tarpaulins for tent floors. Mr. Ban called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and to cooperate with the joint security commission - agreed on during the week-long peace negotiations that ended yesterday in Algiers - that will be led by the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali ([MINUSMA](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusma)). Critics have said that annual floods are worsened by bad irrigation systems and polluted rivers and waterways. An official added that the facilities are using Jhelum river water and are purifying all chemical and bacterial contamination. To help reduce this risk, MdM is working in partnership with aid organization Solidarités International to equip families with in-home chlorination kits, hygiene kits, and latrine kits, and to provide training on the proper assembly and use of the kits. The country, which decided last year to abandon nuclear power, was forced to bring several reactors back on line to deal with the peak in electricity demand, the daily Handelsblatt reported. Following that quake then-Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhyono said that Tsunami alerts went out swiftly to Indonesians and there were no casualties or major damage reported. While agriculture is a key area, as it affects both food security and livelihoods, it remains the least funded sector in the Revised Flash Appeal of 10 July, with unmet requirement of US$51 million. It is China\\'s largest single donation to WFP, adding the country\\'s donation to WFP this year to 20 million U.S. dollars, according to the release.

As was known, Bosnia and Herzegovina\\'s hydropower-energy potential was huge, and more than half of its land was covered with forests, an excellent source of biomass energy, he said. Just one drop of chlorine purifies water for drinking, killing the cholera bacteria and other water-borne diseases. We do this by strengthening early warning systems and preparedness, like in Latin America; integrating disaster risk reduction with disaster response, as we did in Bangladesh; providing training such as improved farming methods in Afghanistan to help people withstand future disasters; and helping build resilience to the effects of climate change, as in Vietnam and Mozambique.
